Download With Extension
================

Download With is an extension that overrides the default download operation and instead sends it to a defined external program. It's based off code from [OpenWith](https://github.com/darktrojan/openwith) and used it as the foundation.

The purpose of this addon is to bring back support for your own external download manager, without having to use a specific program with included integrations.
